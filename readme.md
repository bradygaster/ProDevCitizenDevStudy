# Pro Dev & Citizen Dev App Model

This series of walk-throughs present two phases of the application development lifecycle when building HTTP APIs that are used by buisiness apps. We have two goals in this discussion:

1. We'd like to understand how pro developers - *those who build the HTTP APIs and back-end services* - feel about the experience of building and using HTTP APIs as back-ends for business applications.
1. We'd like to understand how citizen developers - *those who build front-ends atop those APIs* - feel about the experience of using HTTP APIs when building business apps.

## Get Started

* If you're a software developer who builds back-end APIs and software services using IDEs and programming languages, continue on to the [pro dev](phase1-pro-dev.md) guide.

* If you're a citizen developer who builds Flows, Forms, or Power Apps that make use of HTTPs via Custom Connectors, continue on to the [business dev](phase1-citizen-dev.md) guide.
